    tx,ty = the point handed to the real vehicle: a fixed point on the
    bot's heading line, `distance` ahead of the bot, that the vehicle
    closes on -- never a point that runs away from it, and never one
    that falls behind it.

    x,y,theta -- bot pose (sim frame)
    rx,ry     -- vehicle's live position (sim frame, same units as x,y)
    distance  -- lookahead distance ahead of the BOT, sim units

                 how far ahead of the vehicle to keep it instead.
                 Defaults to half `distance`.

    `along` is the vehicle's signed progress along the bot's heading:
    >0 means it has already passed the bot going that way. Anchoring
    the target to that progress (target_along = along + distance) is
    what misbehaves once the vehicle gets ahead -- the target then
    advances by exactly as much as the vehicle does, so the vehicle
    chases a carrot it can never reach and keeps building lead on the
    bot. Behind, the same formula is self-stabilising (the gap grows,
    giving a far target and a gentle straight-line pursuit), which is
    why only the "ahead" case shows the problem.

    So `along` is used here purely as a floor, not as the anchor: the
    target normally sits at a FIXED `distance` ahead of the bot, so a
    vehicle that is ahead actually closes on it and bleeds off its
    lead. Only when the vehicle has genuinely overflown that point
    does the target get pushed out, and then just by min_lead -- far
    enough to avoid commanding a reversal a fixed-wing can't fly.
