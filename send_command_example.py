"""
Example UDP client for sending mission commands to the swarm backend
(main.py).

main.py listens for commands on UDP port 12008
(swarm_tasks/network/UDP.py's UDPReceiver), bound to the machine's own
LAN IP -- the one it prints at startup ("Ip address: ..."), NOT
127.0.0.1/localhost. Each datagram is decoded as a plain UTF-8 string
and matched against the if/elif chain at the bottom of main.py, so the
wire format below has to match that exactly: same delimiter, same field
order, same JSON-encoded sub-fields. It's fire-and-forget -- main.py's
loop never sends a reply back over this socket.

Usage:
    python send_command_example.py                 # runs the demo below

    from send_command_example import SwarmClient
    client = SwarmClient("192.168.1.42")            # IP main.py printed
    client.search(center_lat=12.93, center_lon=80.02, num_uavs=10,
                  grid_space=50, coverage_area=2000)
    client.close()
